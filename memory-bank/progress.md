## In Progress
- 🔄 Improving speech recognition accuracy
- 🔄 Enhancing keyboard script capabilities
- 🔄 Refining error handling and recovery mechanisms
- 🔄 Adding more detailed feedback on command execution
- 🔄 Optimizing performance and reducing latency

## Pending Features
- ⏳ Multiple alternative phrases for commands
- ⏳ Advanced script validation and testing
- ⏳ User preferences and settings
- ⏳ Command categories for organization
- ⏳ Script templates and examples
- ⏳ Detailed command execution history
- ⏳ Microphone selection and audio settings

## Known Issues
- 🐛 Speech recognition occasionally misses commands in noisy environments
- 🐛 Some applications block keyboard simulation due to security measures
- 🐛 WebSocket connection can sometimes disconnect and require refresh
- 🐛 Script parser doesn't validate syntax before execution
- 🐛 Recognition state may not persist correctly after unexpected shutdowns

## Technical Debt
- Lack of automated tests
- Limited error logging and diagnostics
- Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- No proper application packaging/installer
- Limited documentation for advanced usage

## Project Evolution
The project has evolved from a simple proof-of-concept to a more robust application:

1. **Initial Prototype**: Basic speech recognition with hardcoded commands
2. **Database Integration**: Added persistence for commands and phrases
3. **Web Interface**: Created UI for command management
4. **Script System**: Developed flexible keyboard scripting syntax
5. **Real-time Updates**: Added WebSockets for immediate feedback
6. **Error Recovery**: Implemented automatic recovery from failures

## Next Development Phases
1. **Robustness Phase**: Improve error handling, recovery, and validation
2. **Usability Phase**: Enhance UI, add templates, improve organization
3. **Performance Phase**: Optimize latency and resource usage
4. **Extension Phase**: Add additional features like mouse control or macros

## Deployment Status
The application is currently in development and can be run locally by users. There is no packaged installer or deployment system yet. Users need to:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies via pip
3. Run the application with Python
4. Access the web interface via browser
