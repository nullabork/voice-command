# Project Brief: Voice Command System

## Overview
The Voice Command System is a web application that listens to voice commands and executes corresponding keyboard actions. It is designed to enable hands-free control of applications, particularly useful for games like Digital Combat Simulator (DCS) or other software where voice control would enhance user experience.

## Core Objectives
- Allow users to control applications via voice commands
- Provide a simple, intuitive web interface for managing command mappings
- Execute keyboard sequences based on recognized voice phrases
- Maintain high accuracy in voice recognition
- Support customizable keyboard scripts with precise timing control

## Target Users
- Gamers seeking hands-free control options
- People with accessibility needs requiring voice control
- Users who perform tasks requiring both hands but need computer input
- Power users seeking to optimize their workflow

## Success Criteria
- Reliable speech recognition with minimal false positives
- Low latency between voice command and keyboard action execution
- Intuitive interface for managing command mappings
- Resilient system that recovers from failures automatically
- Configurable enough to handle complex keyboard sequences

## Project Scope
### In Scope
- Voice command recognition via microphone
- Web interface for command management
- Customizable keyboard script system
- Real-time feedback of recognized speech
- Toggle to enable/disable voice recognition
- Error recovery mechanisms

### Out of Scope
- Speech synthesis/text-to-speech capabilities
- Mouse movement simulation (keyboard only)
- Natural language processing beyond direct command matching
- Mobile application versions
- Cloud-based processing (local processing only)

## Timeline and Priority
The core functionality is to be implemented first, followed by refinements to the user interface. The project is intended for ongoing development with continuous improvements to recognition accuracy and script capabilities.

## Integration Requirements
The system needs to work with:
- Any application that accepts keyboard input
- System default microphone
- Modern web browsers for the control interface
