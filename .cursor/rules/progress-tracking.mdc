# Progress Tracking Guidelines

When working on this project, follow these guidelines for tracking progress:

## Updating the Implementation Plan

- As you complete tasks in the [implementation plan](mdc:memory-bank/plan.md), add checkmarks (✅) next to completed items.
- If a task turns out to be unnecessary, mark it with (❌) and add a note about why it was skipped.
- For tasks in progress, consider marking them with (🔄).

## Reporting Issues

- If you encounter problems with a specific component, document them in the plan file under the relevant section.
- Create a "Known Issues" section at the end of the plan when necessary.
- Format issues with: ⚠️ [Component] - Brief description of the issue

## Adding New Requirements

- When new requirements are identified, add them to the [requirements document](mdc:memory-bank/requirements.md).
- Then reflect these new requirements in the plan by adding new tasks.
- Mark new tasks with (➕) to indicate they were added after the initial plan.

## Example Update Format

```markdown
7. **Backend - Speech Recognition:**
   - ✅ Integrated the `speech_recognition` library
   - ✅ Implemented microphone listening loop
   - 🔄 Adding error handling for network failures
   - ❌ Custom speech model integration (unnecessary, using Google API instead)
   
Known Issues:
- ⚠️ Speech Recognition - Occasional delays when network connection is slow
```
