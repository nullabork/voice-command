# Memory Bank Guidelines

The Memory Bank is my sole source of project information between sessions. At the start of every task, I MUST read ALL Memory Bank files to understand the project context and current state.

## Core Files

I MUST read these files in the following order:

1. **[projectbrief.md](mdc:../memory-bank/projectbrief.md)** - Fundamental project goals and scope
   - Foundation for all other documentation
   - Defines core requirements and integration needs
   - Reference for project scope decisions

2. **[productContext.md](mdc:../memory-bank/productContext.md)** - User needs and problem space
   - Explains why this project exists
   - Details user experience goals
   - Describes key use cases

3. **[systemPatterns.md](mdc:../memory-bank/systemPatterns.md)** - Architecture and design patterns
   - System architecture diagram
   - Design patterns in use
   - Module interactions and flows
   - Threading model

4. **[techContext.md](mdc:../memory-bank/techContext.md)** - Technical implementation details
   - Technologies and libraries
   - Database schema
   - Development environment
   - File structure
   - Technical constraints

5. **[activeContext.md](mdc:../memory-bank/activeContext.md)** - Current development status
   - Current focus areas
   - Recent changes
   - Upcoming priorities
   - Active decisions
   - Design preferences

6. **[progress.md](mdc:../memory-bank/progress.md)** - Project progress tracking
   - Completed features
   - In-progress work
   - Pending features
   - Known issues
   - Technical debt
   - Next development phases

7. **[requirements.md](mdc:../memory-bank/requirements.md)** - Detailed requirements
   - Core functionality requirements
   - Configuration and management specifications
   - Script format requirements
   - Non-functional requirements

8. **[tech-stack.md](mdc:../memory-bank/tech-stack.md)** - Technology stack details
   - Backend technologies
   - Frontend technologies
   - Architecture specifics
   - Communication protocols

## Memory Bank Workflows

### Memory Reset Protocol
1. At the start of EVERY session, read ALL Memory Bank files
2. Reference specific files when addressing particular aspects of the project
3. Update memory files when:
   - New implementation patterns are discovered
   - Requirements change
   - Technical decisions are made
   - Progress milestones are reached

### Update Procedure
When updating Memory Bank files:
1. Review the current content for accuracy
2. Update information reflecting current state
3. Maintain chronological records of major decisions
4. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md
5. Ensure all files remain consistent with each other

## Key Principles

1. The Memory Bank is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
2. No implementation decisions should contradict Memory Bank documentation
3. All critical insights must be documented for future reference
4. Documentation should be kept concise yet complete
5. Updates should be made immediately when significant changes occur

REMEMBER: I depend entirely on these files between sessions. Their accuracy and completeness are critical to my ability to assist effectively with this project.
